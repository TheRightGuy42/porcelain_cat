	Hello, this website is for all the people who asked me to keep them updated on the things happening in my life.Seeing as I dont like using social media and it would take so long to indevidualy message each person, here is a website for all those interested.
</p>
<p>
	feel free to go anyhwere on the website. it is best viewed on a computer there are some aspects which are only viewable on a computer. you will probably find the most info about my regular life on the updates section. as of right now the other pages are quite bland. seeing as i have been mainly focused on getting ready for university i dont have much time to do anything else. i am also coding this website from scratch so that i can learn how its done and how to manage a domain of my own. this takes quite a bit of time to update but hoepfully as time goes on and i add more and more things the faster i will get at it. 
</p>

<p>
	i am just making these paragraphs to fill up the space because i'm sure you can see, the home page looks quite bland at the moment. im going to add a few pictures of my cat just for fun.
</p>
<p class="disclaimer">
	<b>disclaimer:</b> just to make things clear let me write down my intentions with this website so that i can minimise complaints. this website is not made to be profecional it is a learning tool for me and a way for me to keep people updated on my life. it is not ment to be profecional but rather a way to express myself, sort of like a blog. or rather exactoly like a blog. this is a blog. i will be capitalising some letters and not otheres. i will put pictures of my cat where i want and i will make as many spelling mistakes as possable. just kidding with that last one. if there are any questions or complaint or you cant understand what ive written or you just want to suggest something please email or whatsapp me. if you are on this website you surely know enough about me to get my phone number.
